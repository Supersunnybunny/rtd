pipeline script generates reference-sorted, indexed BAM from uniqued reads from radtag sequencing lanes.

To generate uniqued reads, see preprocess_radtag_lane.py

four accessory programs and three python libraries are used, listed below.
for parallel execution, GNU parallel is also HIGHLY recommended. 
Experimental LSF support is also available.
